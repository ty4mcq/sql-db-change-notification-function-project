# SQL DB Change Notification Function Project

This is a project to design and implement infrastructure as a proof of concept.

## Scenario

You are an Azure Developer joining a team responsible for designing, developing, and deploying cloud-based solutions on the Microsoft Azure platform. Your role involves crafting highly available, secure, and efficient applications that empower clients to achieve their business goals through cloud technology.

## Key Requirements

- [ ] Develop a cloud-native application using Azure services such as Azure Functions, Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Logic Apps. Ensure scalability, reliability, and security of the application.
- [ ] Integrate the Azure-based application with on-premises systems and third-party services using Azure Logic Apps, Azure API Management, and Azure Service Bus.
- [ ] Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps or similar tools for automating deployment processes. Utilize infrastructure as code (IaC) using Azure Resource Manager templates.
- [ ] Ensure security measures are implemented within the Azure solutions, adhering to industry standards and data protection regulations. Conduct security assessments and audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Set up Azure Monitor and Application Insights to monitor application performance proactively. Optimize resources for cost efficiency based on performance insights.
- [ ] Maintain comprehensive documentation of architecture, designs, and deployment processes to facilitate knowledge transfer and future support.

## Questions

- [x] Develop an Azure Function that triggers a notification whenever a new record is added to an Azure SQL Database. Describe the architecture of your solution and how you ensure the function's scalability and reliability.
- [x] Integrate an Azure Logic App with an on-premises legacy system using Azure Service Bus. Explain the communication flow between the Logic App and the on-premises system, ensuring security and reliability.
- [ ] Configure a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps for automating the deployment of a web application hosted on Azure App Service. Provide a step-by-step guide on setting up the pipeline and deploying the application using infrastructure as code.
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for an Azure solution to ensure proper authorization and compliance with data protection regulations. Discuss your approach to managing user roles and permissions securely.
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting using Azure Monitor and Application Insights for an Azure-based application. Describe the key metrics you would monitor and how you would optimize resources based on performance insights.
- [ ] Create documentation for the architecture, designs, and deployment processes of an Azure-based project. Include guidelines for maintaining and updating the documentation for future reference.
